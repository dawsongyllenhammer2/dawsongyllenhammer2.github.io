                Hello! My name is Dawson Gyllenhammer, and I’m currently studying 
                Graphic Design at Western Washington University. I love creating 
                custom typography, and building poster designs as personal projects.
                As of now, I plan to pursue a career in the UI/UX industry, but I 
                also have some interest in branding, as well as product packaging design. I really 
                like developing and refining new skillsets in the larger world of design, so 
                I’m always open to learning new things. In general, I also really love type 
                hierarchy and creating dynamic type systems using grid structures. This 
                industry is so big and varied, and i’m very excited for what the future holds.
